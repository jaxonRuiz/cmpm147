// Here is how you might set up an OOP p5.js project
// Note that p5.js looks for a file called sketch.js

// Constants - User-servicable parts
// In a longer project I like to put these in a separate file
const VALUE1 = 1;
const VALUE2 = 2;

// Globals
let myInstance;
let canvasContainer;
var centerHorz, centerVert;

function resizeScreen() {
  centerHorz = canvasContainer.width() / 2; // Adjusted for drawing logic
  centerVert = canvasContainer.height() / 2; // Adjusted for drawing logic
  console.log("Resizing...");
  resizeCanvas(canvasContainer.width(), canvasContainer.height());
  // redrawCanvas(); // Redraw everything based on new size
}

function preload() {
  preloadEngine();
}

// setup() function is called once when the program starts
function setup() {
  // place our canvas, making it fit our container


  setupEngine();
  // resize canvas is the page is resized  
  $(window).resize(function() {
    resizeScreen();
  });
  resizeScreen();
}

// draw() function is called repeatedly, it's the main animation loop
function draw() {
  background(220);    

  drawEngine();
}

// mousePressed() function is called once after every time a mouse button is pressed
function mousePressed() {
    // code to run when mouse is pressed
