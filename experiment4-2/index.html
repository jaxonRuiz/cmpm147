				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This is an infinite tile matching game. Match as many tiles as possible, while optionally keeping the number of misses as low as possible. Using the shift key can temporarily reveal the tiles at the cost of a point every second</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Tile colors are generated at random based on a hash, which can be uncovered when selected. Matched tiles are marked as completed, and locked from selection. Though tiles are hidden, their color value for matching remains consistent due to hashing.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I didn't expect to spend as much time as I did, but the implementation of tile selection/matching logic was an interesting challenge, especially on a hashed, infinite canvas. The game was incredibly basic initially, but incrementally adding visual elements helped to make the final result feel much more satisfying.</p>
