				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I was originially trying to make a city landscape, but ended up prefering a more abstract style, and set up the shapes to be visually interesting as they change to the mouse position</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Boxes are generated on a flat tile grid with slightly varied heights and colors on a flat tile grid, to appear to have volume. Attributes that coorispond to the size and shape of the boxes are made to change based on their distance from the mouse, giving a kind of rippling effect.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I didn't originally like the direction this project was going in, but after accepting a more abstract visual style, I found the final result a lot more appealing.</p>
			</div>
