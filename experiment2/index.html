				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I worked with Cole to try to make a cyperpunk style cityscape. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>For the buildings we used custom shapes and some trigonomotry to get the angle of the buildings. We didn't manage to get the varied building angles to work in the end, but I want to come back and fix it at some point, when I have more time
					We organized the scene into layers using a custom LayerManager class to be able to organize the multiple layers we ultimately used.
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Both me and Cole were tight on time leading up to this project, and weren't able to work as much as I would have liked, but I'm still quite happy with the final result. Despite some incredibly confusing issues with p5 shapes with classes, as well as the process of transferring from glitch to vscode, we still managed to finish. I was surprised how a few entirely design decisions ended up being found by accident, such as the transparent ground or angle we ended up using for the buildings. </p>
